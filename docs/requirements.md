# Algorithms
- [ ] Cross-table parameterised SQL (need JOINs and this is ticked)
- [ ] Aggregate SQL functions (calculations - will be useful for random frontend info)
- [ ] User/CASE-generated DDL script (useless)
- [ ] Graph/Tree Traversal (tree might be needed for the problem difficulty evaluator algorithm)
- [ ] List operations (not needed)
- [ ] Linked list maintenance (not needed)
- [ ] Stack/Queue Operations (might do this)
- [x] Hashing 
- [ ] Advanced matrix operations
- [ ] Recursive algorithms (might have already done this)
- [ ] Mergesort or similarly efficient sort
- [ ] Dynamic generation of objects based on complex user-defined use of OOP model
- [x] Server-side scripting using request and response objects and server-side extensions for a complex client-server model
- [ ] Calling parameterised Web service APIs and parsing JSON/XML to service a complex client-server model


# Characteristic
- [ ] Modules (subroutines) with appropriate interfaces.
- [ ] Loosely coupled modules (subroutines) – module code interacts with other parts of the program through its interface only.
- [x] Cohesive modules (subroutines) – module code does just one thing.
- [x] Modules(collections of subroutines) – subroutines with common purpose grouped.
- [ ] Defensive programming.
- [ ] Good exception handling.
- [ ] Well-designed user interface (hardest one here)
- [x] Consistent style throughout
- [x] File paths parameterised
